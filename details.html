    <p align="center">Now that we know the top countries with homellesness lets see what 
        challnges are faced by  the homeless</p>
        <h1 align="center">Challenges faced by the homeless</h1>
        <p align="center">One challenge the homeless face is the 
            inaccessibility to shelters. <br> Although 
            shelters are available for the homeless 
            in certain cities, many homeless people 
            choose to not utilize them and live on the 
            streets instead due to various different reasons. <br>
            One reason is that homeless individuals who are 
            affected by mobility issues cannot access them and 
            are unsure about how shelters function. <br> Shelters also demand a small fee per night, 
             immediately rendering them inaccessible for many homeless.
