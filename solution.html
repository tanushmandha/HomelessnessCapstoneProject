<div align="center" id="solution"><p>Government should pickup  homeless people and segregate 
    them like people who have medical issues should be moved to the hospital and 
    the people who are fine should be taken to a shelter and give then a particular
     ID. Those people will be working on Government land in which they do farming,working 
     in different industries.They will be provided shelter,food medicine and everything 
     necessary for living by the owner of the industry. They will be free to levae the 
     job and go but if the government finds them again homeless they will be imprisoned 
     and will not be provided the same thing as before.
